# Revelo

**Photography gallery with smooth animations, intelligent search, and automatic image processing**

</div>

I have too many hobbies, but the only one most people would call _artistic_ is photography. I mostly take pictures for myself, but I wanted a place to collect and showcase them, something that felt a bit more special than the usual platforms out there.

**Revelo** (from _photographic development_ in Spanish) is my playground for experimenting with modern web technologies, AI integrations, and infrastructure. It’s very much a work in progress, but you can check it out live at [revelo.app](https://revelo.app)!

> [!WARNING]
> The live instance is hosted on my own _homelab server_. This gives me flexibility to tinker with the stack, and direct access to the hardware, but it also means uptime might be spotty depending on my ISP's mood.
